# Implementing SSL/TLS in Rust

This repository is for trying to rewrite the contents of [this book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IK9TVO) in Rust.

# Building and Running

This project uses Cargo but has multiple binary target, HTTP client and server. So you need to specify binary when you run it.

```
$ cargo run --bin <name> -- <args>
```

See `Cargo.toml` about `<name>`.
